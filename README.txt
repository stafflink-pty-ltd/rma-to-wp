Imports data from Rate My Agent via their API into WordPress.

== Description ==

Importing data from API's is never easy. This plugin simplifies the process by importing reviews
for agents. All you need is a premium Rate My Agent Account and this plugin. To display your reviews, 
you'll also need either a developer or the premium reviews slider by Stafflink and/or the property display theme.

== Installation ==

Simply install the plugin, navigate to RMA to WP under the settings, and click the initial import button to get started.
The plugin keeps content up to date on a daily schedule. Be aware, any content imported will be overwritten by this plugin
if RMA has updates for the property or review. This is to stay compliant so we're always showing their data correctly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I see properties or reviews on my website? =

For that you'll need a developer to get the data and display it in your theme. We will soon have a premium theme that
does this for you.

= How much does this cost? =

The data fetching plugin is free, but to display the data, you'll need a premium RMA account.

== Changelog ==

= 0.0.1 =
* Initial build.
